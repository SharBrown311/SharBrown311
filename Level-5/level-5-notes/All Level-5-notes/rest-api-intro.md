HOW DO I WANT TO ORGANIZE MY INFORMATION WHEN BUILDING MY API: ???


        example practice: 
        //camping goods store
              //tents
              //sleeping bags
              //cooking
              //etc.

    /tents
      /sleepingbags
        /


# Middleware - a function that fires on the inbetween 


# Request Body (req.body)
