- **`pwd`** tells you what directory you are currently in.
- **`ls`** lists the files and folders in the current directory.

-mkdir : makes a new folder in the current directory

-touch: creates a new file with the name and extension given.

-rm : deletes a file or folder. Use it with -r to force it to delete a folder even if there are still objects in the folder you are trying to delete.

-mv : to rename a file, you would do 
  # mv oldFileName.js newFileName.js

  or 

  # mv fileToMove.txt ../../my-folder/things-i-save/notes/

-cp : [file to be copied] [where to put copy] copies the files that you name. 

-cp -r : [new directory name] will copy a directory.

nano will open a text editor, if we say nano [file that already exists] we will be editing that file , but if we say nano [new file that doesnt exist yet] we will create a new file and start editing it.
