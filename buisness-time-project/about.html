    <h1>About Accessorized Gaming</h1>
    <p id="aboutP">Your friend has one, your brother has one, your cousin has one, your cousins’ brothers’ friend has one,<br>
        and suddenly you decide that this overpriced piece of plastic <br>
        you bought to enhance your gaming experience is one of a million <br>
        and not worth what you paid for it. It ends up in the bottom of <br>
        a box at the back table of a yard sale and you end up selling it for<br> 
        five bucks, or even worse in the trash because it broke after three <br>
        months of use.<br>
                    <br>
        Here at Accessorized Gaming, we know what your money means to <br>
        you and what you went through to get it. Stop shopping at those stores and sites that lick their<br>
        lips every time you click add to cart or the bell dings as you walk in the store.<br>
        We don't accept junk into our inventory, because we are also consumers and know <br>
        what it feels like to be dissatisfied with bad customer service and an inadequate product. <br>
        Our mission is to make gaming accessible, affordable, and enjoyable for everyone and anyone,<br> 
        by supplying quality accessories from our shelves to your home.<br>
        We hope you love us , the way we love our customers, and you become ACCESSORIZED!<br>
        </p>
