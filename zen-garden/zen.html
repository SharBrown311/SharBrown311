      <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible 
        <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s, broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned browsers.
      </p>
      <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the 
        <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WASP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.

      <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the 
        time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.

      <h3 class = "sub-heading">So What is This About?</h3>
      <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of 
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, 
        and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list.
        Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into 
        this very page. The 
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that 
        has changed is the external 
        <abbr title = "Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.</p>
      <p>
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over 
        the style of a hypertext document. The only way 
        this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it 
        can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands 
        of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have 
        contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it 
        further.

      <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong 
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> 
        skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even 
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> novices
         can use them as starting points. Please see the <a class="hyperClique" 
         href="#" 
         title="A listing of CSS-related resources"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
          Resource Guide</a> for advanced tutorials and 
         tips on working with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.
        </p>
      <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the 
        <abbr title = "HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This may seem
         daunting at first if you&#8217;ve never worked this way before, but follow the 
         listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a 
         guide.
        </p>
      <p>Download the sample <a class = "link" href = "#" title = "This page's source HTML code,
         not to be modified.">HTML</a> and <a class = "link" href = "#" 
         title = "This page's sample CSS, the file you may modify." >CSS</a> 
         to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece 
         (and please, don&#8217;t submit half-finished work) upload your 
         <abbr title = "Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file to a web server 
         under your control. <a class= "link" href = "#" title = "Use the contact form to 
         send us your CSS file">Send us a link</a> to an archive of that file and all 
         associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on 
         our server.</p>

    <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing 
      people how amazing <abbr title = "Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> really can be.
       This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the 
      web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we
       can all look forward to.

        <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title = "Cascading Style Sheets, levels 
          1 and 2">CSS 1 &amp; 2</abbr> usage. 
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 &amp; 4</abbr> should 
          be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong 
          fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical <abbr 
          title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not 
          the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real 
          requirement we have is that your 
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.
        </p>
        <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented 
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. 
          When sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most 
          modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user 
          agents on the web these days &#8212; especially when you factor in mobile &#8212; 
          pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every 
          platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in 
          at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, 
          iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).
        </p>
        <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep 
          objectionable material to a minimum, and try to 
          incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We&#8217;re well past 
          the point of needing another garden-related design.
        </p>
        <p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your
           graphics (with limited exceptions, see <a class = "link" href = "#">submission guidelines</a>),
            but we ask you release your <abbr title = "Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> under a 
            Creative Commons license identical to the <a class = "link" href = "#" title = "View the 
            Zen Garden's license information.">one on this site</a> so that others may learn from your
